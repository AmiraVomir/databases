# databases
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

This project explores SQL to interact with a MySQL database.

## Goals

* Identify the benefit of using a database
* Create a schema using SQL
* Use Sequelize to abstract database query code
* Define common terms associated with databases design
* Describe relationships between various entities
* Use SQL statements to query and modify data in a database
* Distinguish between SQL and NoSQL databases
* Describe how databases acheive O(1) access
